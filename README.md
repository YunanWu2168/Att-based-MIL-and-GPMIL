# Att-based-MIL-and-GPMIL
This is the code for the paper "Combining Attention-based Multiple Instance Learning and Gaussian Processes for CT 
Hemorrhage Detection" published in MICCAI 2021.


# Phase 1
The code for the first phase, please check the dataset and more details in this link [Here](https://github.com/YunanWu2168/SA-MIL)

# Phase 2
The code for the phase two described in the paper can be found in the folder phase_2_vgpmil. It also containes 
pre-extracted features such that the phase 2 can be run independently to obatin the final results of the paper.
Please read the instructions in 'phase_2_vgpmil/README.md' for details how to run the code.
